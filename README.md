### Conclusion

I learned a lot about Next.js and Vercel platform. Very easy to setup, manage, and deploy. Lots of great examples from vercel and the community.

I'm glad I finally jumped on TypeScript which forces you to code better but a bit more difficult when pasting around snippets ðŸ¤ª

Very happy with the technologies used go forward. Excited to learn more!
